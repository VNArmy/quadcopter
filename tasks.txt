Tasks:
* Compile quadcopter code into hex file (done)
* Upload hex file to Arduino Yun (done)
* Compile an Arduino library with the code (done)
* Update readme file (done)
* Allow the quadcopter to be made up of multiple files (needs doing) 
* Figure out how to print serial commands to command line (done)
* Figure out how i2c communication works with Wire and with the Yun
* Look into compiler warning: ignoring packed attribute because of unpacked non-POD field (....) (needs doing)


Nice to haves
* Destroy the scons file: it would be nice to have one place that defines the build.
* Use an IDE: we would get faster feedback on compile errors.
* Work out how much of the code we've written is testable
