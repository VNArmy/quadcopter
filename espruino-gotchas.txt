Gotcha!

- no regular expressions
- no exceptions
- Error object does not exist at all
- Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty not implemented (almond, requirejs)
- 0.1 is falsy on the espruino (incorrectly it seems)
- Loading one basic AMD module uses 1/3 of the available memory - ouch.
    before: "free":1787, "usage": 13, "total":1800
    after:  "free":1215, "usage":585, "total":1800
- Loading in a ~300 unminified file with lots of whitespace and comments causes an Out of Memory Error.
- Array performance:
   a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] uses 22 storage RAM blocks.
   b = new Int8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) uses 12 storage RAM blocks.
   (this is because a normal array is stored as a map, meaning a key and
   a value are stored for each element)
